# spring-pet-clinic
Another version of the Spring Pet Clinic

In John Thompsons Udemy course 'Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru' he shows how to design and implement a Spring Boot Web Application (https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/).
It is modeled on the Spring Pet Clinic example that demonstrates the use of Spring Framework with Spring MVC and Spring Data (https://projects.spring.io/spring-petclinic/).
